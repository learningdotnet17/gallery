I've been making landscape photographs since 2014. I enjoyed posting these on 500px at first. When 500px website sold, I deleted my account and started posting my photos on Instagram. I've made a lot of friends on Instagram over the years and have learned a few things about photography along the way. Multiple photos have been reshared on Instagram and well liked by fellow New England photographers.
